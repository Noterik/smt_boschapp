Bosch app
====================

One of the applications that was build during the EuropeanaSpace hackathon. It uses the multiscreen toolkit, to create a spotlight on a painting and play sounds on predefined characters in the painting

1) Check out smt_boschapp in Eclipse
2) Build a war using the 'deploy-war' task with the provided build.xml
3) Do not deploy it in tomcat!, we use the war format but it should be loaded in Lou so use the application manager
